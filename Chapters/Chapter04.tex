\chapter{Image Decomposition}\label{ch:decomposition}
%************************************************

In this chapter, we will focus on those \ac{CAD} systems that use a combination of an image decomposition method and feature selection by means of hypothesis testing. These variety of methods have been published in \cite{Martinez201141,Martinez-Murcia20129676,Martinez-Murcia2013255,Martinez-Murcia201458}. 

Image decomposition methods model a set of samples as a linear combination of $c$ latent variables, also known as components. These variables can be considered as the basis of a $c$-dimensional space where each sample is represented by a feature vector of length $c$. The $i$-th neuroimage in our dataset can be therefore decomposed as: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:generalDecomposition}
	\mathbf{x}_i = s_0 \mathbf{w}_0 + s_1 \mathbf{w}_1 + \dots + s_c \mathbf{w}_c + \boldmath\epsilon = \mathbf{s}\mathbf{W} + \boldmath\epsilon
\end{equation}

Where $s_i$ is the coordinate (or component score) of the current image in the $i$-th dimension of the new space defined by all the base vectors $\mathbf{w}_i$ (component loadings), and $\boldmath\epsilon$ is the error of the estimation. Figure \ref{fig:decomposition_overview} shows an illustration of the process.

Many signal decomposition techniques are used in the literature, for example \ac{PCA} or \ac{PLS} \cite{Spetsieris2009,Illan2011,Towey2011,Segovia2013,Khedher2015}. We will focus on two less known decomposition algorithms \acf{FA} and \acf{ICA}, which we will integrate in different \ac{CAD} systems using a pipeline similar to the one displayed at Figure~\ref{fig:pipelineDecomposition}. This pipeline involves feature selection (for reducing the dimensionality), decomposition of the feature vectors and classification.

\section{Feature Selection}
Feature selection is the first strategy used for feature reduction \cite{Martinez-Murcia2016b}, and it is often used along with feature extraction in order to build more complex pattern recognition systems. It refers to any strategy intended to find a subset of the original features containing the more suitable ones according to a certain criterion. Therefore, irrelevant features are discarded, and resultant models are faster and more cost-effective \cite{Guyon03}. However, it usually requires an additional optimization to find the parameters for the optimal feature subset, and furthermore, it is impossible to guarantee that the optimal features for the subset are the same of the full feature set \cite{DaelemansHosteMeulderEtAl2003}. 

In this work, we will use filtering methods to perform feature selection. As we introduced in Section~\ref{sec:mvanalyses}, filtering methods are based on the computation of a feature relevance score directly on the data. The relevance score is used to sort the different features, discarding those with a lower score, and it is usually computed independently for each feature, in what is called a univariate approach \cite{SaeysInzaLarranaga2007}. 

Feature selection can be used before or after feature extraction. When using computationally-intensive algorithms such as \ac{FA} or especially \ac{ICA}, the selection of best features prior to the decomposition is key to obtain high performance while keeping the computation times small \cite{Martinez201141,Martinez-Murcia20129676}. This also removes noise in some cases where the decomposition algorithm cannot compute correctly the variance.

\end{figure}

Three feature selection algorithms have been used in this thesis, not only in the \ac{CAD} systems proposed in this chapter, but in many other models that will be presented later: the $t$-Test, the Kullback-Leibler divergence or Relative Entropy, and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test. 

\subsection{$t$-test}
The $t$-test is an old friend of statisticians. In this work we will use the independent two-sample $t$-test \cite{Fay10}. It quantifies the differences between two classes using an assumption of independent variances. Let $X_i^f$ a vector containing the $f$-th feature of all elements in class $i$. The $t$-score of the $f$-th feature can be computed as:

\begin{equation}
t_f = \frac{\bar{X}_1^f - \bar{X}_2^f}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{X_2^f}^2+\sigma_{X_1^f}^2}{n}}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{X_i^f}^2$ is the variance and $\bar{X}_i^f$ is the average of the $f$-the feature within class $i$. The $t$-test is extensively used in the neuroimaging community, and it is the basis for the \ac{SPM} and \ac{VBM} analyses \cite{spm_book}. See figure~\ref{fig:ttest_map} for an example of the $t$-test computed on the ADNI-PET database.

\subsection{Kullback-Leibler Divergence} 
Another alternative is the \acf{KL} divergence, also known as Relative Entropy. It is a non-symmetric measure of the difference between two probabilities distributions. Let us assume that $X_1^f$ and $X_2^f$, the vectors containing the $f$-th feature of all elements in class $i$, are two discrete random variables. Therefore, the \ac{KL} divergence can be calculated with equation \ref{kullback} \cite{Theodoridis1999}.

\begin{equation}\label{kullback}
KL_f = \left(\frac{\sigma_{X_2^f}^2}{\sigma_{X_1^f}^2} +\frac{\sigma_{X_1^f}^2}{\sigma_{X_2^f}^2} -2 \right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\bar{X}_2^f-\bar{X}_1^f\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_{X_1^f}^2} + \frac{1}{\sigma_{X_2^f}^2}\right)
\end{equation}
using the same notation than in $t$-test. See figure~\ref{fig:kl_map} for an example of the computed \ac{KL} divergence on the ADNI-PET database.

\subsection{Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon} 
The \acf{MWW} rank test, also known as $U$-test, assigns a rank to all values in the vector corresponding to the $f$-th feature, $X^f$, without considering any class. The method used to assign a rank is the `average', which means that each value is assigned with the average of the ranks that would have been assigned to all the tied values. This means that, for example, in the case of the vector $X^f=(0,2,3,2)$, the ranks assigned to each element would be $R^f=(1,2.5,4,2.5)$. 

Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the number of elements in class 1 and 2 respectively, and $R^f$ the vector of ranked elements. We proceed by selecting the first $n_1$ elements in $R^f$ by: 
\begin{equation}
	R^f_{n_1} = {R^f_i} \quad \forall i\in(0,n_1)
\end{equation}

The $U$-score for the $f$-th feature and the first class will be: 
\begin{equation}
	U_1^f = n_1 n_2 + n_1 \frac{n1+1}{2} - \sum R^f_{n_1}
\end{equation}

And the it can be computed for the second class as the remainder: 
\begin{equation}
	U_2^f = n_1 n_2 - U_1
\end{equation}

The final $U^f$ can be assigned to either $U_1^f$, $U_2^f$ or $\min{U_1^f,U_2^f}$ \cite{Fay10}, but the usual approach nowadays is to assign $U^f=U_2^f$. Unlike $t$-test, \ac{MWW} test does not assume any prior distribution, and therefore is less likely than it to spuriously indicate significance because of the presence of outliers. Under the normal distribution, it performs relatively similar \cite{Fay10}. See figure~\ref{fig:wilcoxon_map} for an example of the \ac{MWW} $U$-test computed on the ADNI-PET database.

\section{Decomposition Algorithms}
The feature selection algorithms presented above will perform a significant feature reduction, from hundreds of thousands of voxels to a few thousands. These few thousands voxels are considered the best in discriminating between \ac{CTL} and affected subjects in each of the diseases. The feature selection strategy can be thought of as a mask, in which only the most relevant regions according to the tests are selected (see Figure~\ref{fig:comparisonSelection}). 

However, this number of features is still large, and therefore, further feature reduction can be applied by performing a decomposition of the masked regions. We have used two algorithms in our \ac{CAD} systems: \acf{FA} and \acf{ICA}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Factor Analysis}
\acf{FA} was used in \cite{Martinez201141,Martinez-Murcia20129676} to perform feature extraction in \ac{CAD} systems. This strategy assumes that each image in the database is a realization of a given experiment. \ac{FA} then models each of the $N$ observations (or subjects) as the expression of $c$ unobserved variables, known as factors. The model follows the general decomposition equation (Eq. \ref{eq:generalDecomposition}), but assuming that the dataset matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is zero-centred. That is, that we have subtracted the mean prior to the computation. In matrix form, Eq. \ref{eq:generalDecomposition} can be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:factoranalysis}
\mathbf{X} -\boldsymbol{\mu}= \mathbf{S}\mathbf{W} +  \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{equation}

The columns of $\mathbf{W}$ are known as factors, and the rows of $\mathbf{S}$ are known as loadings  (similar to the concept of component loading and component scores in \ac{PCA}). Thanks to this, we can convert the original dataset $\mathbf{X}$ of size $N\times f$ into $\mathbf{S}$, of size $N\times c$. The procedure of computing the decomposition imposes some assumptions on $\mathbf{W}$: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathbf{W}$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ must be independent. 
	\item $E[\mathbf{W}] = 0$. 
	\item $\text{Cov}(\mathbf{W}) = \mathbf{I}$, which ensures that the factors are uncorrelated. 
\end{itemize}

Now we can rewrite Eq.~\ref{eq:factoranalysis} as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fastep1}
	\text{Cov}(\mathbf{X} -\boldsymbol{\mu})= \text{Cov}(\mathbf{S}\mathbf{W} +  \boldsymbol{\epsilon})
\end{equation} 

Under the previous constraints, and setting $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \text{Cov}(\mathbf{X} -\boldsymbol{\mu})$, Eq.~\ref{eq:fastep1} becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{S}\text{Cov}(\mathbf{W})\mathbf{S}^T - \text{Cov}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})
\end{equation}

Since $\text{Cov}(\mathbf{W}) = \mathbf{I}$, and making $\text{Cov}(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{\Psi}$, the diagonal matrix containing the specific variances of the reconstruction error, we obtain the alternative form of \ac{FA}: 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}^T - \boldsymbol{\Psi}
\end{equation}

The mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, and the matrices $\mathbf{S}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Psi}$ are obtained via Maximum Likelihood estimation. To guarantee an unique solution, we impose that $\mathbf{S}^T\boldsymbol{\Psi}^{-1}\mathbf{S}$ is a diagonal matrix. Then, we obtain the parameters by maximizing the log-likelihood given by the following expression: 
\begin{equation}
	\ell(\mu,\mathbf{S},\boldsymbol{\Psi}) = - \frac{np}{2}\log{2\pi}- \frac{n}{2}\log{\left|\mathbf{SS}^T + \boldsymbol{\Psi}\right|} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf{x}_i-\mu)^T(\mathbf{SS}^T+\boldsymbol{\Psi})(\mathbf{x}_i-\mu)
\end{equation} 

\ac{FA} differs from \ac{PCA} mainly because it performs an estimation of the noise, and needs the number of factors $c$ as an input. Choosing $c$ is not a naive task. A large $c$ can yield a small reconstruction error, but the factors will not be representative enough, leading to overfitting of the subsequent model. Conversely, a small $c$ can lead to a large reconstruction error, causing information loss. We have computed the reconstruction error variance over the ADNI-PET dataset, and plotted it in Figure~\ref{fig:error} (similar graphs can be obtained for other databases. This proves that the error is assymptotical as we increase $c$, and therefore, once arrived at certain error, the improvements are not significant. To observe how the error affects the reconstruction, in Figure~\ref{fig:reconstructionFA} we can compare a reconstructed image with its corresponding original.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Independent Component Analysis}
<<<<<<< HEAD
\acf{ICA} \cite{Hyvarinen2000} is an algorithm that performs decomposition imposing that the resulting components must be independent. It was used in \cite{Alvarez2009,Martinez201141,Martinez-Murcia20129676} as part of a \ac{CAD} system, and it had been used in other medical imaging applications such as segmentation \cite{DeMartino2007}. 

\ac{ICA} was born as a solution to the \textit{blind source separation} problem, in which the aim is to estimate $c$ independent sources from a series of mixed signals \cite{Hyvarinen2000}. To do so, we assume the source signals to be non-gaussian, in addition to the independence assumption that we mentioned before. That is why their authors consider \ac{ICA} to be a non-gaussian version of \ac{FA} \cite{Hyvaerinen2003}, although due to this assumption, the results are very different to those obtained in \ac{FA}. 
=======
\acf{ICA} \cite{Hyvarinen2000} is an algorithm that performs decomposition imposing that the resulting components must be independent. It was used in \cite{Alvarez2009,Martinez201141,Martinez-Murcia20129676} as part of a \ac{CAD} system, and it had been used in medical image segmentation as well \cite{DeMartino2007}. 


>>>>>>> 75a4ab11e3b1e5f3c31cce8cf3f7b7ba5da56079

Unlike \ac{FA}, \ac{ICA} does not account for noise in the estimation procedure, and therefore the equation remains: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:icaecuation}
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{W}\mathbf{S}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{S}$ are the component scores and $\mathbf{W}$ are the component loading, `sources' or `mixing matrix'. Given that \ac{ICA} lacks a noise term, there is a procedure called \textit{whitening} that must be applied for the algorithm to converge \cite{Hyvarinen2000}. The whitening implies a linear transformation of the $i$-th observed variable $\mathbf{x}_i$ into a \textit{white} vector $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i$ so that its covariance matrix equals the identity: 

\begin{equation}
E\{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i^T\}=\mathbf{I}
\end{equation}

This procedure is often performed using the \acf{EVD} of the covariance matrix $E\{\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i^T\} = \mathbf{E}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{E}^T$. $\mathbf{E}$ is the covariance matrix containing the eigenvectors of $E\{\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i^T\}$, and $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of $E\{\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i^T\}$. Whitening is done using the following equation: 

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i= \mathbf{E}\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\mathbf{E}^T\mathbf{x}_i
\end{equation}

This procedure transform the mixing matrix to:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i = \mathbf{E}\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}\mathbf{E}^T \mathbf{W}\mathbf{s}_i
\end{equation}
which is indeed orthogonal, as can be seen here:
\begin{equation}
 E\{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_i^T\} = \tilde{\mathbf{W}} E\{\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_i\tilde{\mathbf{s}}_i^T\}\tilde{\mathbf{W}}^T 	=\tilde{\mathbf{W}}\tilde{\mathbf{W}}^T=\mathbf{I}
\end{equation}
 
This property reduces the number of parameters to be estimated, since an orthogonal matrix contains $n(n-1)/2$ degrees of freedom, in contrast to the $n^2$ degrees of freedom of the original mixing matrix $\mathbf{W}$. 

Thanks to the central limit theorem, we assume that the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the individual statistical distributions \cite{Rice2006}. This property is used to maximize non-gaussianity and independence in the sources using any independence criteria such as the kurtosis or negentropy in any of the proposed algorithms. In this work, we will use the FastICA algorithm. 

\subsubsection{FastICA}
FastICA is a block fixed-point iteration algorithm \cite{Oja1997,FastICA99} based on negentropy as a non-gaussianity measure. Fixed-point algorithms are converge faster than adaptive algorithms \cite{FastICA99}. The FastICA algorithm can be considered a neural algorithm \cite{Hyvarinen2000}, where the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ can be updated using a learning rule. FastICA defines a learning rule that finds a direction $\mathbf{w}$, a unit vector such that the projection $\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}_i$ maximizes non-gaussianity \cite{FastICA99}. 

The non-gaussianity measure used here is the negative entropy, or negentropy. The negentropy is a form of differential entropy, which for a random vector $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
	J(\mathbf{y})=H(\mathbf{y}_{gauss})-H(\mathbf{y})
\end{equation}
where  $\mathbf{y}_{gauss}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ share the same covariance matrix, although $\mathbf{y}$ is not a gaussian random variable, and $\mathbf{y}_{gauss}$ is. There are many approximations to negentropy. The FastICA defines negentropy using the function: 
\begin{equation}
J(y)\propto [E\{G(y)\}-E\{G(\nu)\}]^2
\end{equation}
where we assume that $y$ is of zero mean and unit variance, $\nu$ is a Gaussian variable sharing the same mean and variance, and $G(x)$ is any non-quadratic function. Many functions have been proposed, but in the FastICA algorithm we use either $G(x)_1 = (1/a_1) \log\cosh a_1 x$ with $1<a_1<2$ or $G(x)_2 = \exp(-x^2/2)$ \cite{FastICA99}. 

With these measures, we can compute the derivatives of these functions by: 
\begin{align}
g_1(x) & =\tanh(a_1 x), \\
g_2(x) & = x\exp(- x^2/2)
\end{align} 

The algorithm for the one-unit version of FastICA can be defined \cite{FastICA99} as:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose an initial (e.g. random) weight vector ${\bf w}$.
	\item Let  ${\bf w}^+=E\{{\bf x}g({\bf w}^T{\bf x})\}-E\{g'({\bf w}^T{\bf x})\}{\bf w}$
	\item Let  ${\bf w}={\bf w}^+/\Vert{\bf w}^+\Vert$
	\item If not converged, go back to 2.
\end{enumerate}

The algorithm considers that the values of $\mathbf{w}$ converge when their dot product is close to 1, that is, they are pointing in the same direction. Note that the expectations are computed as the sample mean in the FastICA algorithm. Additional modifications were presented in \cite{Hyvarinen2000}, in which step 2 is converted to a Newton iteration and further simplification is performed. 

This is the algorithm for one computational unit, or neuron, which computes one component. However, the procedure can be extended to $c$ components by defining $c$ neurons with weight vectors ${\bf w}_1,...,{\bf w}_c$ so that $\mathbf{W} = ({\bf w}_1,...,{\bf w}_n)^T$. The outputs ${\bf w}_1^T{\bf x},...,{\bf w}_n^T{\bf x}$ must be decorrelated to prevent them from converging to the same maxima, using three methods proposed in \cite{Hyvarinen2000}. 

The method used in this work uses a two-step iterative algorithm \cite{Hyvarinen2000} to decorrelate the outputs after each iteration: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{W}/\sqrt{\lVert\mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^T\rVert}$. 
\item Let $\mathbf{W} = \frac{3}{2} \mathbf{W}-\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{W}^T  \mathbf{W}$
\end{enumerate}

And repeat step 2 until convergence. For simplicity, the norm in step 1 can be computed as any norm but the Frobenius norm, for example, the L2-norm or the largest absolute row sum. 

\section{Results}
In this work we will analyse the behaviour of the system proposed in the introduction and illustrated at Figure~\ref{fig:pipelineDecomposition}. The system comprises the selection of the most relevant voxels using filtering methods (we will focus on $t$-test, relative entropy and wilcoxon) and a feature decomposition of these using either \ac{FA} or \ac{ICA}. Finally, the feature vectors are classified using a \ac{SVC} with linear kernel, and performance values are obtained via cross-validation (see Section~\ref{sec:validation} for more information). 

We vary the number of selected voxels and the number of factors or components depending on the algorithm and the dataset used and evaluate the system with those characteristics. That way, we obtain an estimation of the performance of the system in different situations, so that we can draw conclusions on the disease patterns and the ability of the system in the detection of different diseases. 

\subsection{Alzheimer's Disease}
We begin by applying the proposed feature selection plus decomposition pipeline to the two functional neuroimaging datasets: ADNI-PET and VDLN-HMPAO. For this experiment we will use a maximum of $20,000$ selected voxels and $25$ components. 

\subsubsection{Factor Analysis}\label{sec:results_FA_AD}
First, we use \ac{FA} as a decomposition technique. In Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyMeanFA-AD} we average the accuracy over the number of voxels or the number of components respectively, to look at how these variables affect the performance of the system, and we do this for the three filtering methods used.

	\label{fig:accuracyMeanFA-AD}
\end{figure}

We can observe that the results are generally better when using the ADNI-PET dataset than with the VDLN-HMPAO, and this is especially notorious when using the relative entropy selection criterion. The performance tends to slightly increase with the number of voxels selected, but it is not the case with the number of components. By looking at figures \ref{fig:AD-AV-FA-TTEST-VSK}, \ref{fig:AD-AV-FA-ENTROPY-VSK} and \ref{fig:AD-AV-FA-WILCOXON-VSK}, it seems that a relatively small number of components (approximately 6) is enough to obtain good performance, and afterwards, the performance holds or even decreases. 

\subsubsection{Independent Component Analysis}
In this section, we compute the results of applying \ac{ICA} to the ADNI-PET and VDLN-HMPAO datasets. Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyMeanICA-AD} depicts the average accuracy over the number of voxels or the number of components respectively for the different selection criteria.

The case is similar to the one presented in Section~\ref{sec:results_FA_AD}, where the performance slightly improves when increasing the number of selected voxels. The performance is again better when using the ADNI-PET dataset than with the VDLN-HMPAO, although the behaviour is similar. 

The results change when varying the number of components. In this case, although good performance is obtained within the first 5 components in most cases, the model achieves similar performance in both datasets with components between 5 and 10, and then, the estimates diverge. In the VDLN-HMPAO, the performance starts to decrease after this number of components, whereas when using the ADNI-PET dataset, the higher average performance is obtained with $c>15$, especially in the case of the $t$-test or the wilcoxon selection criteria). 

\subsubsection{At the Operation Point}
Now we focus on non-averaged values, the values for which our system is optimal: the operation point. In this scenario we see that the tendency is that all systems behave similarly. 

When increasing the number of selected voxels, we can see that there is always a tendency of slightly increase in both datasets and decomposition strategies, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyOP-ADvsN}. For the ADNI-PET dataset, the maximum accuracies are obtained with a large number of voxels $f>15000$, however, in the case of VDLN-HMPAO, we obtain similar performance with fewer voxels, $f<7000$ in all selection criteria.

	\label{fig:accuracyOP-ADvsN}
\end{figure}

Now we can focus on the performance variations over the number of components in Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyOP-AD}. The accuracy slightly varies almost in any case, and there is a steep increase in the performance within the first five components in both \ac{FA} and \ac{ICA}.

	\label{fig:accuracyOP-AD}
\end{figure}

A particular case is the combination of \ac{FA} and the relative entropy selection criteria applied to the VDLN-HMPAO dataset. In this case there seems to be a trend to achieve a maximum performance at between 5 components. But with the ADNI-PET dataset, the performance keeps and achieves maximum accuracy with $c\approxeq 20$. 

In Table~\ref{tab:featureAD} we show the performance values obtained at the operation point for our different test combining decomposition algorithms and selection criteria, for the two datasets analysed in this section. It is obvious that both datasets obtain similar performance in almost every case, with values close to $0.9$.

Overall, all methods achieve similar values of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. When analysing the ADNI-PET dataset, the wilcoxon selection criteria seems to outperform the rest especially with \ac{ICA}, with a higher accuracy and sensitivity. On the other hand, with the VDLN-HMPAO dataset, either the $t$-test or the wilcoxon achieves higher sensitivity, but there is no difference in accuracy when decomposing with the \ac{ICA} algorithm. When using \ac{FA} decomposition, the relative entropy seems to perform better. In general, there seems to be little difference among methods, and a curious relationship between the relative entropy selection and the VDLN-HMPAO dataset that we will discuss later.

\subsection{Parkinson's Disease}
Now we will look at how the proposed \ac{CAD} system behaves when applied to the three DaTSCAN datasets: VDLN-DAT, VDLV-DAT and PPMI-DAT. For this experiment we will use a maximum of $1500$ selected voxels and $25$ components. 

\subsubsection{Factor Analysis}
Firstly, we will explore the average behaviour of the system that uses \ac{FA} as a decomposition technique. For this purpose, as in previous sections, Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyMeanFA-PKS} shows how the average performance varies when varying the number of voxels selected and the number of components extracted.

	\label{fig:accuracyMeanFA-PKS}
\end{figure}

In this case there is a clear difference between datasets, since some of them are more complex than others, usually due to a typical acquisition procedure in DaTSCAN. In the VDLN-DAT, the images were often composed only of a few cuts around the striatum, whereas in PPMI and VDLV-DAT this rarely happens. That would explain the average outperformance of these two datasets over the VDLN-DAT in almost all cases. 

Their behaviours are consistent. Usually, there is no variation with the number of voxel selected (except in the obvious case of the VDLN-DAT dataset and the relative entropy selection criterion). However, there are repeated trends regarding the number of components or factors used in the computation. We can see that the performance increases in the first components, and once we have achieve a decent number (between 4 and 6), the performance starts to decrease. This could mean that the decomposition in more than 5 or 6 components only introduces noise and leads to a wrong decomposition. 

Again, this behaviour is consistent with the VDLN-DAT dataset, except for one case. It does seem that the interaction between the VDLN-DAT dataset and the relative entropy selection criterion leads to a wrong model. We will explore this question later, in the discussion. 

\subsubsection{Independent Component Analysis}
Regarding the application of the \ac{ICA} decomposition model to the DaTSCAN datasets. In Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyMeanICA-PKS} we present the average accuracy achieved by this model using three different selection criteria and the three \ac{PKS} datasets.

	\label{fig:accuracyMeanICA-PKS}
\end{figure}

In average, PPMI-DAT and VDLV-DAT achieve similar performance, while VDLN-DAT generally achieves much poorer results. However, the behaviour of the system when varying the number of voxels or number of components is similar in all three datasets. The tendency is that accuracy does not significantly vary when increasing the number of voxels (except in the case of the relative entropy and VDLN-DAT). In contrast, when varying the number of components, we observe that the maximum performance is achieved in the first components, typically between 5 and 10. 

\subsubsection{At the Operation Point}
Let us now have a look at the behaviour of this system at the operation point, using the parameters $c$ and $f$ for which our system is optimal. When varying the number of voxels selected, we obtain the graphs presented at Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyOP-PKSvsN}. 

\begin{figure}

	\caption[Performance at the operation point for the \acs{PKS} datasets, over the number of selected voxels.]{Performance of the proposed system using the two \ac{PKS} datasets: PPMI-DAT, VDLN-DAT and VDLV-DAT at the operation point, and how they vary over the number of selected voxels. } 
	\label{fig:accuracyOP-PKSvsN}
\end{figure}

In this case, we obtain again that our system maintains approximately the same performance regardless of the number of voxels selected when tested on both the PPMI-DAT and the VDLV-DAT datasets. In contrast, the performance increases when increasing the number of selected voxels when testing the VDLN-DAT dataset, especially when using the relative entropy criterion. This latter dataset also obtains less performance, whereas the VDLV-DAT achieves the best. 

As for the changes in performance when varying the number of components, the results for both \ac{FA} and \ac{ICA} based systems are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accuracyOP-PKS}. 

\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:accuracyOP-PKS}
\end{figure}

In this first case, the most evident result is the general performance of our system in the three datasets. It is clear that the system performs better when tested on VDLV-DAT than when tested on PPMI-DAT, and both datasets outperform, VDLN-DAT. It is even clearer that when testing on VDLV-DAT, the results are similar using any type of decomposition and selection criteria, with similar performance. We will discuss this issue in more detail later. 

The tendency of the performance at the operation point is similar to the average behaviour commented before. In general, there is an accuracy increasing in the first components (usually, between 5 and 10 depending on the decomposition) and then, the performance remains stable. Again, the combination of relative entropy selection and VDLN-DAT achieves striking results. For this dataset, the higher performance is obtained with more than 10 components ($c=14$), and shows higher variability than other datasets. 

Now we will focus on the specific performance values obtained at the operation point, that can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:featurePKS}. In this table we observe the differences in performance between datasets and also between \acp{CAD} using each decomposition strategy.
