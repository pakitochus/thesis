Multicentre studies with structural \ac{MRI} and functional \ac{MRI} (f\ac{MRI}) are increasingly common, allowing for recruitment of larger samples in shorter periods of time. However, the use of images acquired at different sites still poses a major challenge. In addition to logistical difficulties, such as regulatory approvals and data protection, a number of technical and methodological issues can potentially affect the resulting maps, introducing undesired intensity and geometric variance. This issue has been addressed in other neurological conditions, such as \ac{AD} \cite{Jovicich2006,Stonnington2008}, where group differences are well known, and demonstrating that the impact of a correction for site on the resulting neurobiological differences is relatively small. However, these effects have a stronger impact in psychiatric conditions where the atypical radiological signs on \ac{MRI} are often subtle and require large samples of patients to observe on-average differences relative to control samples. Recent meta-analyses point to differences being inconsistently reported in schizophrenia \cite{friedman2006report,Turner2013}, psychosis \cite{Clementz2015,Wang2015}, and \ac{ASD} (using the multi-centre ABIDE database) \cite{haar2014anatomical}

These inconsistencies can arise from a variety of variance sources, ranging from the multi-level (phenotypic, neurobiological, and etiological) heterogeneities of the conditions to technical issues that include differences in scanner make, model, manufacturer, static field strength, field inhomogeneities, slew rates and image reconstruction \cite{VanHorn2009}, as well as acquisition problems such as within-acquisition participant head motion. Field inhomogeneities are a source of misinterpretation of the data even when the same \ac{MRI} system manufacturer and model are used \cite{VanHorn2009}. Furthermore, results in \cite{Pearlson2009} demonstrate that a single scanner can change with time, which makes some widely used strategies, for example collecting controls first and patients later, a flawed approach. Recent neuroimaging research on \ac{ASD} \cite{haar2014anatomical} has shown that, while analyses performed on a particular database (acquired on a single platform) could yield coherent regions, the atypical structures are often inconsistent across the wider literature using different databases. Therefore, new methodologies focused on reducing multi-site variance may be potentially helpful in increasing the power to identify the characteristic neurobiological signature of autism, should there be one.

\section{Significance Weighted Principal Component Analysis}
The \acf{SWPCA} is an algorithm to reduce, in this case, undesired intensity variance introduced by multi-site image acquisition. \ac{SWPCA} takes any dataset of pre-processed images, spatially normalized, and decomposes them into their variance components to then provide a corrected dataset where these undesired variance components have been reduced. To do so, \ac{PCA} was applied to each modality in turn to obtain the component scores and component loadings. Since \ac{PCA} is a data-driven approach, it was only used to decompose the source images, and after this procedure, a one-way \ac{ANOVA} estimated the relation between each variance component and a given categorical variable, in our case, the acquisition site. The between-site variability in the variance component was then identified by its corresponding \textit{p}-value. Finally, these \textit{p}-values were transformed into a weighting matrix  $\boldsymbol\Lambda$ that weighted the influence of each variance component in a final \ac{PCA} reconstruction of the corrected maps. The procedure is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:swpcaschema}.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}\label{sec:pca}
The first step in the \ac{SWPCA} algorithm was to perform a \ac{PCA} decomposition
of the dataset into a set of orthogonal components that model the
variance present in the images. 

\ac{PCA} is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations $\mathbf{X}$ of possibly correlated variables, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $K\times N$ matrix, with $K$ participants (in this case, with one image per participant) and $N$ the number of voxels, into a set of $N$ linearly uncorrelated variables called Principal Components (PC, also known as component loadings or the mixing matrix)  $\mathbf{W}$ of size $N\times N$ whose linear combination using a vector of component scores  ${s}_{K}$ can perfectly recompose each image. The set of these component scores  $\mathbf{S}$ (size $K \times N$) was estimated as:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}^T
\end{equation}

This transformation computes a sequence of PCs, maximally explaining the
variability of the data while maintaining orthogonality between
components. \ac{PCA} was computed using \acf{SVD}:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^*
\end{equation}

where  $U$ is an $K\times K$ orthogonal matrix,  $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ is a $K\times N$ diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and the $N\times N$ unitary matrix  $\mathbf{V}^*$ denotes the conjugate transpose of the $N\times N$ unitary matrix  $\mathbf{V}$. With this decomposition both the component scores and estimates of the set of components loadings  $\mathbf{W}$ were obtained. In this work the truncated form of \ac{SVD} was used such that only the first $C$ components were considered, where most of the variability of the data was concentrated:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{S}_C = \mathbf{U}_C \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_C = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}_C
\end{equation}

where  $\mathbf{S}_C$ is the set of component scores using the first $C$ components (size $K\times C$). To achieve reasonable performance with minimal information loss, it was assumed that the number of components was the same as the number of images, $C=K$. Thus, a partial reconstruction of the original signal could be undertaken:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:swpcareconst}
	\hat{\mathbf{X}}=\mathbf{S}_C \mathbf{A}_C
\end{equation}

where  $\mathbf{A}_C$ is the pseudoinverse of the truncated matrix of
component loadings  $\mathbf{W}_C$, and  $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ is the
reconstructed set of images.


Intuitively, PCA defines a new space where the first spatial direction is defined so that it explains the maximum variance in the data. The subsequent directions will try to explain the remaining variance in decreasing order. All these directions, or components, are meant to be uncorrelated. This way, the maximum information about the data is contained in the first components, and the remaining can be considered noise. 

Mathematically \cite{Brown2009}, PCA works as an orthogonal transformation that maps a correlated set of observations $\mathbf{X}$ (in this work, our set of images, of size $K\times N$ containing $K$ images of length $N$) into a set of uncorrelated data $\mathbf{S}$ that contains $K$ vectors in a $M$-dimensional space, defined by $\mathbf{W}$, a vector whose $M$ columns contains the basis of the new space. That way, the mapping is obtained by: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pcabasic}
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}
\end{equation}
where the columns of $\mathbf{W}$ contain the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X}$, the empirical covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$. 

This is done, ideally, by obtaining the eigenvalue decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix of the data. A very extended way of computing $\mathbf{W}$, the matrix of eigenvectors, also known as `eigenbrains' in the neuroscience literature \cite{Illan2011}, is via the \acf{SVD} of $\mathbf{X}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^* 
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{U}$ is a $K\times K$ orthogonal matrix, $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a $K\times M$ non-negative real diagonal matrix, and the $M\times M$ unitary matrix $\mathbf{V}^*$ denotes the conjugate transpose of the $M\times M$ unitary matrix $\mathbf{V}$. Using this decomposition, we can rewrite Eq.~\ref{eq:pcabasic} as: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trunkPCA}
\mathbf{S} =  \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma} 
\end{equation}
Given that the conjugate transpose of a unitary matrix is its inverse, the matrix $\mathbf{W}$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{V}$. There exist very efficient algorithms to compute the \ac{SVD}. In this work, we will use an implementation that computes only the first $K$ components for efficiency.  


\subsection{One-Way Analysis of Variance}
The estimated PCs effectively model the variability of the image dataset. The next step was to assess each PC as a source of inter-site variance with one-way \acf{ANOVA}. \ac{ANOVA} estimates the $F$-statistic, defined as the ratio between the estimated variance within groups and the variance between groups:
\begin{equation}
F=\frac{M{S}_{\mathit{within}}}{M{S}_{\mathit{between}}}=\frac{S{S}_{\mathit{within}}/(G-1)}{S{S}_{\mathit{between}}/(K-G)}=\frac{\sum
	_{i}{{n}_{i}{\left({\bar{{Y}}}_{i}-\bar{{Y}}\right)}^{2}/{\left(G-1\right)}}}{\sum
	_{\mathit{ij}}{{\left({Y}_{\mathit{ij}}-\bar{{{Y}_{i}}}\right)}^{2}/{\left(K-G\right)}}}
\end{equation}

Where  $M{S}_{\mathit{within}}$ \ and  $M{S}_{\mathit{between}}$ are the mean squares within- and between-groups respectively, $G$ is the number of separate groups (in our case, two),  $\bar{Y}$ is the sample mean of a certain feature (in our case, the sample mean of all $K$ values of a given component score),  ${\bar{Y}}_{i}$ is the sample mean of the features belonging to group $i=1\dots G$, ${Y}_{\mathit{ij}}$ is the $j_{th}$ observation of a feature belonging to group \textit{i} and  ${n}_{i}$ is the number of participants in the  $i_{th}$ group. The $F$-distribution allows an easy computation of $p$-values, given the number of groups and degrees of freedom. The $F$-statistic and $p$-values were computed independently for each component score and acquisition site, and then used in the \ac{SWPCA} algorithm.

\subsection{Weighting Function}
To obtain a set of corrected maps, a new signal matrix of all maps of the same modality,  $\widehat{\mathbf{X}}$, was estimated with the influence of the PCs with variance related to acquisition site, assessed via the $p$-values, reduced. To do so, equation~\ref{eq:swpcareconst} was modified to include a square matrix $\boldsymbol\Lambda$ (dimension $C\times C$) whose diagonal contains a weight ${\lambda }_{c}$ for each component that depends on its $p$-value; that is,

\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\mathbf{X}} = \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{A}
\end{equation}

The computation of each ${\lambda }_{c}$, for each component, was performed using the Laplace distribution, modified so that the weights were on the interval [0, 1]:
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda_{c}(p_c, p_{th}) = 1-e^{\frac{-p_c}{p_{th}}} \quad \forall p_c \in \left[0,1\right]
\end{equation}

where  ${p}_{c}$ is the statistical significance of the $c_{th}$ component with respect to the acquisition site and ${p}_{th}$ is the statistical threshold for significance; that is,  ${p}_{th}$=0.05. A plot of the univariate weighting function $\Lambda_c(p_c,p_{th})$ can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:swpcasweigthing}. This weighting ensured that most of the components of variance that are not related to the acquisition site are kept unchanged, while at the same time it strongly reduces the influence of components with $p$-values less than the threshold. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Graphics/ch7/weighting2}

	\label{fig:swpcasweigthing}
\end{figure}

This procedure is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:swpcaboxplot}, where a boxplot of the distribution of the first four principal component scores is shown. Since we have assumed that substantial differences imply a bigger influence of the acquisition site on the portion of variance modelled by that component, the resulting weight is reduced, and the contribution of that component to the reconstructed signal will be smaller. After computing all weights, most of the sources that are related to the acquisition site (for example, the second and third components) have been parsed out while keeping all other sources of variance.

\section{Results for AIMS-MRI Dataset}\label{sec:swpcaAIMSresults}
To validate the effects of the \ac{SWPCA} algorithm on the inter-site variance, experiments were undertaken to assess the reduction of the undesired site variance in the original datasets, and its impact on the between-group signal. Two kind of analysis were performed: a characterization of voxel-wise differences, and a classification analysis. 

Voxel-wise differences between groups were characterized using \acf{VBM} \cite{Ashburner2000}, comprising preprocessing (registration, smoothing) and mass-univariate $t$-test on the smoothed maps from each modality. \ac{SWPCA} is included (when needed) in this pipeline as a plug in, after the smoothing and before the computation of the test. Permutation testing assessed the significance of the relationship between the tested and target variables. A max-type procedure was used to obtain family-wise, whole-brain corrected \textit{p}{}-values (Freedman and Lane, 1983). Additionally, a \acf{CBM}, based on Source Based Morphometry (SBM) \cite{xu2009source} was used. This procedure provided Z-maps for visual inspection comparable to those obtained in \ac{VBM}, by selecting component loadings $\mathbf{W}$, scaling them to unit standard deviation and weighting their contribution to the final map with their statistical significance, computed using the same permutation inference as in \ac{VBM}. 

A classification analysis was undertaken using a common classification pipeline (Khedher, et al., 2015; López, et al., 2009) consisting of preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. \ac{SWPCA} is used as a plug-in here as well, after the preprocessing and before the feature extraction step. We used \ac{PCA} on the images for feature reduction and a \acf{SVC} with linear kernel, as implemented in LIBSVM \cite{Chang2001}, to classify the component scores in both corrected and uncorrected datasets (i.e. with and without \ac{SWPCA}).

The classification was validated using stratified 10-fold cross-va\-li\-da\-tion \cite{Kohavi1995a}. In brief, 9 subsets of the dataset were used for extraction of the PCs and training of the classifier with the remaining subset used for testing. This procedure was repeated for each subset, repeated 10 times to avoid possible bias and random effects of the partitions. The average and standard deviation of the accuracy (acc), sensitivity (sens) and specificity (spec) values for each repetition were recorded. 

For each modality independently, the following experiments were performed: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Experiment 1}: To demonstrate the ability of the \ac{SWPCA} algorithm	to reduce undesired effects due to acquisition site, the \ac{PCA} + \ac{SVC} pipeline was applied to the datasets labelled by acquisition site. Classification accuracy was compared to datasets with and without \ac{SWPCA}. \ac{VBM} was then applied to identify the spatial location of the between-site differences. This was undertaken on the whole database (ALL), and subgroups containing only \ac{ASD} or \ac{ASD} participants. 
	
	\item \textbf{Experiment 2}: The discrimination ability of each modality, acquired at different sites was assessed by classification performance of individuals from London (LON) and Cambridge (CAM) was separately assessed, using group (\ac{ASD} and \ac{CTL}) as the labels. 
	
	\item \textbf{Experiment 3:} To assess the impact of \ac{SWPCA} on the datasets when characterizing the differences between \ac{ASD} and \ac{CTL} groups, the classification pipeline comprising \ac{PCA} + \ac{SVC}, as well as \ac{VBM} and \ac{CBM}, were applied to all participants with group as the labels.
	
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Experiment 1: Effect of Acquisition Site}\label{sec:swpcaE1}
The first experiment was to demonstrate the ability of SWPCA to reduce
the intensity variance related to acquisition site. To do so, we first
performed a \ac{VBM} analysis in all five modalities (\ac{qT1}, \ac{qT2}, \ac{synT1}, \ac{GM} and \ac{WM}) separately, with the uncorrected (without applying SWPCA) and
the corrected (after applying SWPCA) maps, using the acquisition site
as labels. 

To illustrate where the sources of variance of the acquisition sites are
located, Figure~\ref{fig:swpcaFIGURE03} shows a brain $t$-map of significant
($p<0.01$, $|t|>2.57$) \ac{GM} and \ac{WM}
between-site differences. The biggest reductions in variance were found
in \ac{qT1} and \ac{synT1} maps, where high variability between acquisition
sites, especially in the right hemisphere, was substantially reduced
after the application of \ac{SWPCA}. The reduction in the \ac{qT2}, \ac{GM} and \ac{WM}
maps was smaller, although noticeable. 

To quantify the impact of this variance reduction on the between-groups
effects, the classification analysis was undertaken. Higher accuracy
values imply that the maps contain site-related patterns that were
significant, whereas accuracy close to 0.5 indicates that the
site-related variance was low. The test was applied to ALL, and also to
the \ac{ASD} and CTL subgroups. The classification results are presented in
Table~\ref{tab:swpcaAqSite}. 
	
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Graphics/ch7/FIGURE03}
	\caption[Brain t-map (\acs{VBM}) of significant ($p<0.01$, $|t|>2.57$) \acs{GM} and \acs{WM} between-group differences using \acs{qT1}, \acs{qT2}, \acs{synT1}, \acs{GM} and \acs{WM} modalities after applying \acs{SWPCA} to remove site effects.]{Brain t-map (\ac{VBM}) of significant ($p<0.01$, $|t|>2.57$) \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} between-group differences using \ac{qT1}, \ac{qT2}, \ac{synT1}, \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} modalities after applying \ac{SWPCA} to remove site effects.}
	\label{fig:swpcaFIGURE03}
\end{figure}

Performance results indicate clear advantages of using \ac{SWPCA}, in
particular in the case of \ac{qT1} and \ac{synT1} which were associated with
strong site-dependent variance. These results are also consistent with
the reduction of significant between-group areas observed in Figure~\ref{fig:swpcaFIGURE03}.
	
The between-site differences were smaller for \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} maps, possibly
due their reduced sensitivity. Since fractional occupancy values are
abstract, unitless values derived from each image they are less
influenced by the acquisition site effects. For \ac{qT2} maps, the
site-related differences were greater for the CTL participants than \ac{ASD}
where, according to the classification accuracy, they were nearly
indistinguishable. Acquisition site differences were therefore
noticeably reduced in the CTL and ALL databases, but not in the \ac{ASD}.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Within-site Between-Group Differences}\label{sec:swpcaE2}
In this second experiment, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the
between-group comparison were recorded for images acquired from each
site. This is an estimation of the discrimination ability of the
different modalities without the influence of the site effects;
Table~\ref{tab:swpcaLONCAM}. For all modalities, most of the values are close to a random
classifier (\~{}50\%), indicative of having either no significant
differences between groups, or having spatially heterogeneous patterns
of s\ac{MRI} measures across individuals where mass-univariate approaches
are sub-optimal in detecting group differences. It is interesting to
note that the London sample contained more between-group differences
that those acquired in Cambridge.

\subsection{Experiment 3: Effect of \acs{SWPCA} on Group Differences}\label{sec:swpcaE3}
Finally, group differences were characterised with and without applying
site-effects reduction via \ac{SWPCA} to the five modalities. 

Whole-brain \ac{VBM} analysis was performed on the corrected and uncorrected
maps from each modality. Figure 4 depicts the brain $t$-maps
of significant ($p<0.01$, $|t|>2.57$) \ac{qT1}, \ac{qT2}, \ac{synT1}, \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} between-group differences, using ALL, with the GM+WM mask,
before and after applying \ac{SWPCA}, so that the reduction of site-related
variability can be observed. Some of the highlighted areas after
applying \ac{SWPCA} are inconsistent across modalities, with spurious peaks
and noise, including a large area around the ventricles in the \ac{qT1} and
\ac{synT1} modalities related to some abnormal participants that will be
discussed later. However, there were some areas that were consistent
across modalities. Significant areas found across at least 4 of the 5
modalities correspond to the Advanced Automated Labelling (AAL)
(Tzourio-Mazoyer, et al., 2002) areas of: A) right superior frontal
gyrus, Brodmann areas 6 (z=60); B) the pars opercularis of the left
inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann areas 44; C) the pars triangularis of
the left inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann areas 45; D) the posterior
part of the left middle temporal gyrus (z=24); CSF filled spaces on the
margins of the ventricles (z=-6,4,14,24); and the left crus I of
cerebellar hemisphere (z=-26).

	\label{fig:swpcaFIGURE04}
\end{figure}

The complementary CBM (Section 2.4) analysis was performed on the most
significant components. The resulting regions, statistically
thresholded with $Z>2.57$ (corresponding to $p<0.01$), were superimposed on the
\ac{MNI} template, and are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:swpcaFIGURE05}. A reduction of significant
between-group areas after applying \ac{SWPCA} is evident in most modalities,
but particularly noticeable in the \ac{qT1} and \ac{qT2}. In \ac{WM} no significant
regions were observed, neither before nor after \ac{SWPCA}. The significant
regions identified in any modality corresponded to the AAL areas of the
CSF filled areas around the ventricles (planes z=-6, 4, 14, 24), the
right middle temporal gyrus (plane z=14) and the left crus I of
cerebellar hemisphere (plane z=-26). However, none of these regions
were repeated over more than two of the modalities, except for the
large areas around ventricles that were caused by abnormalities in
three participants, which will be discussed later.

Performance results for the classification analysis applied to ALL are
shown in Table~\ref{tab:swpcaALL}. Between-group results were quite similar before or
after applying \ac{SWPCA}, although reducing between-site variance generally
reduced the performance towards a random classifier. The results in
this table match the overall effects that were found in Figure 4, where
most spurious significance peaks disappeared after applying \ac{SWPCA}, but
some regions were highlighted. These regions, where \ac{SWPCA} did not seem
to eliminate the significant areas but enhanced them, could be
responsible for the accuracy increment in the analysis of the \ac{qT2}
modality, and the \ac{GM} with GM mask.

\subsection{Discussion}
Brain anatomical and functional differences between \ac{ASD} participants and
controls have been explored by a number of previous studies (Di
Martino, et al., 2014; Ecker, et al., 2015; Hernandez, et al., 2015;
Lenroot and Yeung, 2013; Zürcher, et al., 2015). Many affected
structures have been proposed in each of these studies, however as a
recent large-scale study points out \cite{haar2014anatomical}, these are
frequently inconsistent throughout the literature. Researchers argue
that most of these structures are database-dependent, and since many
studies use multi-site acquisition procedures, the variance introduced
by each acquisition site is a probable source of Type I errors. 


The technical and logistical drawbacks of multicentre studies are widely
documented, including participant recruitment procedures (Pearlson,
2009) and technical effects that range from the usage of different
equipment or acquisition parameters (Van Horn and Toga, 2009) to
physical changes that affect the performance of \ac{MRI} scanners across
time (Pearlson, 2009). There is general recognition that
standardization is needed to ensure the uniformity of the acquired
maps. Different approaches have been used in large-scale studies, such
as \ac{ADNI} where human
“phantoms” were used to perform a preparatory optimisation of \ac{MRI}
scanning platforms (Friedman and Glover, 2006). 


There are two major types of site effects, regardless of their source:
geometric distortions and intensity inhomogeneities. In this work, we
focused on the latter, since much of the geometric distortion has been
eliminated during acquisition (see Section 2.1), and the DARTEL
normalization and registration acts as a homogenizing step, reducing
both between-site and between-subject geometric differences,
substantially reducing the impact of the site-related geometric
differences. 


Regarding intensity correction, in the \ac{MRC-AIMS} database used in this
study (Ecker, et al., 2013; Ecker, et al., 2012), a standardization
procedure based on quantitative imaging (Deoni, et al., 2008) was used
to minimize inter-site variance and improve the signal-to-noise
contrast. However, as the between-site analysis in Section~\ref{sec:swpcaE1}
suggests, this strategy still results in variance that makes it easier
to distinguish scanning sites than diagnostic groups. For example, when
using \ac{qT1} the accuracy for LON vs. CAM classification was
{\textgreater}80\%, whilst when classifying \ac{ASD} vs. CTL it was 52\%.
This marks the substantial effect of site variance on the maps’
intensity distribution, even when the multi-site study employs
quantitative imaging protocol on the same model of scanner platform
across sites. However, with the inclusion of \ac{GM} and \ac{WM} maps, we can
observe that the inhomogeneities found on \ac{qT1} or \ac{synT1} barely affected
the segmentation procedure. 


In this work, the approach we have taken is to perform a multivariate
decomposition of each dataset into a number of components that explain
different portions of variance. The following step was to identify the
components of variance that are due to multi-site acquisition and
reduce them. Decomposition was completed using \ac{PCA} and then, to
identify which of the components were linked to acquisition site, we
performed an ANOVA on the component scores. Finally, using the
weighting function defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:swpcaE3}, we reconstructed the original
signal reducing the undesired variance, in what we called \ac{SWPCA}. The method has proven its ability in reducing
undesired variance, quantifiable by means of the accuracy obtained in a
site vs. site classification. In this case, \ac{SWPCA} reduced the accuracy
from {\textgreater}0.8 to approximately \~{}0.5, a random classifier,
suggesting that most site-related variance was eliminated. 


A simpler approach such as applying a voxel-by-voxel ANOVA would also be
useful to reduce the acquisition site effects (Suckling, et al., 2012).
However, \ac{SWPCA} is a multivariate approach that still offers major
advantages over this voxel-wise algorithm, and similar algorithms have
found utility in text document searches (Kriegel, et al., 2008; Tavoli,
et al., 2013; Zhang and Nguyen, 2005). First, \ac{PCA} models the different
sources of variance of the dataset, whereas a simple voxel-wise \ac{ANOVA}
only removes mean site differences, which might result in less
statistical power. Secondly, \ac{SWPCA} is multivariate in nature, where
each component contains information that potentially affects all
voxels. Together, these two features allow \ac{SWPCA} to identify the
components linked to the undesired effects, and reduce their impact
with a weighted reconstruction approach, reducing the general variance
related to the acquisition site. However, this increased power reveals
a major drawback: \ac{SWPCA} needs at least a moderate number of
participants to work properly. That is the reason why we cannot apply
\ac{SWPCA} to databases such as ADNI (Friedman and Glover, 2006) or ABIDE
(Di Martino, et al., 2014), where the number of participants acquired
at each site is small, or to the six travelling phantoms used in the
calibration of the \ac{MRC-AIMS} study. 


There exist a number of similar multivariate methods that model the
influence of categorical variables, such as the well-known \acf{PLS} algorithm (Vinzi, et al., 2010) or \acf{SVA} (Leek and Storey, 2007). In the first case,
both \ac{PLS} and \ac{SWPCA} take categorical variables \textbf{Y} along with the
data \textbf{X} as inputs to partition the influence of these into
components. However, the most significant difference is the underlying
model. Whilst \ac{SWPCA} estimates the principal components blindly using
their variance, which is what we aim to reduce, and performs an \ac{ANOVA}
afterwards, \ac{PLS} uses the categorical variable in the computation of the
covariance matrix and then estimates the components. 


On the other hand, \ac{SVA}, used for gene expression studies (Leek and
Storey, 2007), is more comparable to \ac{SWPCA}. The \ac{SVA} algorithm uses a
number of decomposition and significance estimation steps to construct
a set of surrogate variables; that is, variables that account for the
unmodeled variance and expression heterogeneity. While similar to \ac{SWPCA}
in the steps used (i.e. \ac{SVD} decomposition and significance estimation),
their approaches are fundamentally different. \ac{SVA} constructs a higher
complexity model that starts by eliminating the contribution of primary
variables to produce a number of unknown hidden (surrogate) variables,
whereas \ac{SWPCA} is intended to reduce complexity by producing
variance-reduced maps to reduce the influence of previously known, but
unconsidered, variables and facilitate a subsequent analysis focused
only on the relevant variables.


Focusing on the \ac{VBM} results, after performing the site-effects removal
by \ac{SWPCA} significant between-group differences were noted in five
areas: A) the right superior frontal gyrus; B) the pars opercularis of
the left inferior frontal gyrus; C) the pars triangularis of the left
inferior frontal gyrus; D) the posterior part of the left middle
temporal gyrus; and E) the left crus I of cerebellar hemisphere. The
first three regions are within Brodmann areas 6, 44 and 45. However,
when examining the projection of the region D onto the MNI template
(see Figure 6), it is also located in the posterior part of the left
superior temporal gyrus. Therefore, D corresponds closely with the
region between Brodmann areas 22 and 39, the Temporo-Parietal Junction
(TPJ), with negative t-value at the left side (containing
Wernicke's area) and positive t-value at the right
side. 


The role of these regions in autism has received much attention.
Brodmann areas 44 and 45, that together make the Broca’s Area (of
importance in speech production and a proposed part of the human mirror
neuron system (Nishitani, et al., 2005)), is a region where mirror
neuron dysfunction has been consistently reported in \ac{ASD}-affected
children (Dapretto, et al., 2006) and adults (Hadjikhani, et al., 2006;
Lopez-Hurtado and Prieto, 2008; Verly, et al., 2014). Wernicke’s area,
contained in the left TPJ, is also linked to language, and has been
associated with \ac{ASD} in several works (Hadjikhani, et al., 2006;
Kriegel, et al., 2008; Verly, et al., 2014). Additionally, the right
TPJ has been proposed as related to mentalizing and has been repeatedly
implicated in autism (Barnea-Goraly, et al., 2004), including a f\ac{MRI}
study of a subsample of this same AIMS dataset (Lombardo, et al.,
2011). The right superior frontal gyrus (region A) is more equivocal,
with some studies (Ecker, et al., 2010; Ecker, et al., 2012) reporting
abnormalities in this area, while others (Hadjikhani, et al., 2006;
Segovia, et al., 2014) report no significant differences. Our analyses
reveal no differences in the insula and amygdala, brain structures
frequently linked to autism. 


Some regions, particularly in \ac{qT2}, \ac{synT1} and segmented \ac{GM} maps show
potentially spurious significance peaks around the ventricles and
especially in the left crus I of cerebellar hemisphere (region E).
After examining the database, two individuals had appreciable
structural abnormalities in the form of abnormal ventricle size and
cerebellar atrophy, as can be seen in Figure 7. It is possible that
these participants influenced the computation of the \textit{t}{}-maps,
and therefore are responsible for the significance in region E and
areas surrounding the ventricles and, since they are part of the LON
subdataset, could also be responsible for the increased classification
accuracy of the quantitative T1 and T2, and the synthetic T1 maps in
this sub-dataset.


After observing the influence of these participants on the computation
of the \textit{t}{}-maps, we can assume that most of the structural
differences in \ac{ASD} are so subtle that the influence of just one or two
images can impact on the final results. This, along with the poor
performance of the classification pipeline presented in Section 3,
dramatically reduces the significance of the aforementioned
\textit{t}{}-maps. Therefore, the existing evidence leads to the
conclusion that \ac{ASD} presents as either undetectable structural
differences or, more likely, with such heterogeneous differences that
are difficult to establish a common pattern even after reducing the
variance introduced by acquisition site. 


It may be the case that cohorts of individuals examined at different sites are somehow systematically biased towards a specific type of patient (in ways that we cannot see simply based on phenotypic information), then site-related intensity variability is also enriched with important variability about nested autism subgroups. So with any technique trying to remove the site-related inhomogeneity, the subgroup information could also be removed. Together, the evidence supports the claim that defining meaningful subgroups based on different measures, such as genetic profiling, clinical co-morbidities or sensory sensitivities, is the most urgent next step for \ac{ASD} research \cite{haar2014anatomical}.
