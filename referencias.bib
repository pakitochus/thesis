  abstract        = {Motivated by the vast amount of information that is rapidly accumulating about the human brain in digital form, we embarked upon a program in 1992 to develop a four-dimensional probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain. Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

  abstract        = {The registration of images is a task that is at the core of many applications in computer vision. In computational neuroimaging where the automated segmentation of brain structures is frequently used to quantify change, a highly accurate registration is necessary for motion correction of images taken in the same session, or across time in longitudinal studies where changes in the images can be expected. This paper, inspired by Nestares and Heeger (2000), presents a method based on robust statistics to register images in the presence of differences, such as jaw movement, differential MR distortions and true anatomical change. The approach we present guarantees inverse consistency (symmetry), can deal with different intensity scales and automatically estimates a sensitivity parameter to detect outlier regions in the images. The resulting registrations are highly accurate due to their ability to ignore outlier regions and show superior robustness with respect to noise, to intensity scaling and outliers when compared to state-of-the-art registration tools such as FLIRT (in FSL) or the coregistration tool in SPM.},

  abstract        = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

  abstract        = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable Alzheimer's disease.},

After that, voxels which present a Welch's t-statistic between classes, Normal and Alzheimer's images, higher (or lower) than a threshold are selected. The mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis are calculated for these selected voxels and they are subjected as features to linear kernel based support vector machine classifier.

  abstract        = {Image intensity normalization is frequently applied to eliminate or adjust for subject or injection global blood flow (gCBF) and other sources of nuisance variation. Normalization has several other positive effects on the analysis of PET images. However, the choice of an intensity normalization technique affects the statistical and psychometric properties of the image data. We compared three normalization procedures, the ratio approach (regional (r)CBF/gCBF), histogram equalization, and ANCOVA, on both PET count and flow data sets. The ratio method presents the proportional increase of regions, the histogram equalization method offers the relative ranking of intensities over the image, and the ANCOVA method provides statistical deviations from an expected linear model of regional values from the subject's gCBF. The original study used 33 normal subjects in a standard subtraction paradigm. The normalization methods were evaluated on their ability to remove extraneous error variation, induce homogeneity of intersubject variation, and remove unwanted dependencies. In general, the normalization modified the subtraction image more than the individual condition images. All three methods worked well at removing the dependency of rCBF on gCBF in count and flow images. For count data, the three methods also reduced the amount of error variation equally well, improving the signal to noise ratio. For flow data, the histogram equalization and ratio methods worked best at reducing statistical error. All three methods dramatically stabilized the variance over the image.},

This proposed methodology is based on the fact that the histogram of intensity values can be fitted accurately using a positive skewed $\alpha$-stable distribution. Then, the predicted $\alpha$-stable parameters and the location-scale property are used to linearly transform the intensity values in each voxel. This transformation is performed such that the new histograms in each image have a pre-specified $\alpha$-stable distribution with desired location and dispersion values. The proposed methodology is compared with a similar approach assuming Gaussian distribution and the widely used specific-to-nonspecific ratio. In this work, we show that the linear normalization method using the $\alpha$-stable distribution outperforms those existing methods.},

  abstract  = {We present a general method for the classification of independent components (ICs) extracted from functional MRI (fMRI) data sets. The method consists of two steps. In the first step, each fMRI-IC is associated with an IC-fingerprint, i.e., a representation of the component in a multidimensional space of parameters. These parameters are post hoc estimates of global properties of the ICs and are largely independent of a specific experimental design and stimulus timing. In the second step a machine learning algorithm automatically separates the IC-fingerprints into six general classes after preliminary training performed on a small subset of expert-labeled components. We illustrate this approach in a multisubject fMRI study employing visual structure-from-motion stimuli encoding faces and control random shapes. We show that: (1) IC-fingerprints are a valuable tool for the inspection, characterization and selection of fMRI-ICs and (2) automatic classifications of fMRI-ICs in new subjects present a high correspondence with those obtained by expert visual inspection of the components. Importantly, our classification procedure highlights several neurophysiologically interesting processes. The most intriguing of which is reflected, with high intra- and inter-subject reproducibility, in one IC exhibiting a transiently task-related activation in the [`]face' region of the primary sensorimotor cortex. This suggests that in addition to or as part of the mirror system, somatotopic regions of the sensorimotor cortex are involved in disambiguating the perception of a moving body part. Finally, we show that the same classification algorithm can be successfully applied, without re-training, to fMRI collected using acquisition parameters, stimulation modality and timing considerably different from those used for training.},

However, this strategy is prone to the "p-value fallacy" in which effects and interactions are classified as either "noise" or "real" based on whether the associated p value is greater or less than .05. This dichotomous classification can lead to dramatic misconstruals of the evidence provided by an experiment. For example, it is quite possible to have similar patterns of means that lead to entirely different patterns of significance, and one can easily find the same patterns of significance that are associated with completely different patterns of means. Describing data in terms of an inventory of significant and nonsignificant effects can thus completely misrepresent the results. An alternative analytical technique is to identify competing interpretations of the data and then use likelihood ratios to assess which interpretation provides the better account. Several different methods of calculating the likelihood ratios are illustrated. It is argued that this approach satisfies a principle of "graded evidence," according to which similar data should provide similar evidence.},

  abstract = {{INTRODUCTION} We present a method of automatic classification of I-fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy-3\beta-4-iodophenyltropane {(FP-CIT)} images. This technique uses singular value decomposition {(SVD)} to reduce a training set of patient image data into vectors in feature space {(D} space). The automatic classification techniques use the distribution of the training data in D space to define classification boundaries. Subsequent patients can be mapped into D space, and their classification can be automatically given. {METHODS} The technique has been tested using 116 patients for whom the diagnosis of either Parkinsonian syndrome or {non-Parkinsonian} syndrome has been confirmed from post {I-FP-CIT} imaging follow-up. The first three components were used to define D space. Two automatic classification tools were used, na\"ive Bayes {(NB)} and group prototype. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to repeatedly train and test the automatic classification system. Four commercially available systems for the classification were tested using the same clinical database. {RESULTS} The proposed technique combining {SVD} and {NB} correctly classified 110 of 116 patients (94.8\%), with a sensitivity of 93.7\% and specificity of 97.3\%. The combination of {SVD} and an automatic classifier performed as well or better than the commercially available systems. {CONCLUSION} The combination of data reduction by {SVD} with automatic classifiers such as {NB} can provide good diagnostic accuracy and may be a useful adjunct to clinical reporting.},

Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.},

In this study, we have mapped gray matter density by means of voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted MRI volume sets in 19 patients with mild AD and 16 healthy subjects of similar age and gender ratio and report highly significant clusters of gray matter loss with almost symmetrical distribution, affecting mainly and in decreasing order of significance the medial temporal structures, the posterior cingulate gyrus and adjacent precuneus, and the temporoparietal association and perisylvian neocortex, with only little atrophy in the frontal lobe. The findings are discussed in light of previous studies of gray matter atrophy in AD based either on postmortem or neuroimaging data and in relation to PET studies of resting glucose consumption. The limitations of the method are also discussed in some detail, especially with respect to the segmentation and spatial normalization procedures as they apply to pathological brains. Some potential applications of voxel-based morphometry in the study of AD are also mentioned.},

MCI participants that converted to AD (average follow-up 15 months) displayed significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed using a pattern classifier previously constructed from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality scores measured from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas they were positive in almost all MCI converters (MCI-C), indicating extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C. Both MCI subgroups had similar MMSE scores at baseline. A more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification accuracy reaching 81.5\%, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of AD and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual patient basis.},

Regional glucose metabolic rate was not affected by age, but was markedly reduced in {SDAT} patients. These data indicate that in normal aging, structural brain changes may be more salient than biochemical changes. Although both structural and biochemical changes occur in {SDAT,} the biochemical changes are more marked.

  abstract        = {The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) binds with high affinity to beta-pleated sheet aggregates of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in vitro. The in vivo retention of PiB in brains of people with Alzheimer's disease shows a regional distribution that is very similar to distribution of Abeta deposits observed post-mortem. However, the basis for regional variations in PiB binding in vivo, and the extent to which it binds to different types of Abeta-containing plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined 28 clinically diagnosed and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease subjects, including one Alzheimer's disease subject who had undergone PiB-PET imaging 10 months prior to death, to evaluate region- and substrate-specific binding of the highly fluorescent PiB derivative 6-CN-PiB. These data were then correlated with region-matched Abeta plaque load and peptide levels, [(3)H]PiB binding in vitro, and in vivo PET retention levels. We found that in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue sections, the preponderance of 6-CN-PiB binding is in plaques immunoreactive to either Abeta42 or Abeta40, and to vascular Abeta deposits. 6-CN-PiB labelling was most robust in compact/cored plaques in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. While diffuse plaques, including those in caudate nucleus and presubiculum, were less prominently labelled, amorphous Abeta plaques in the cerebellum were not detectable with 6-CN-PiB. Only a small subset of NFT were 6-CN-PiB positive; these resembled extracellular 'ghost' NFT. In Alzheimer's disease brain tissue homogenates, there was a direct correlation between [(3)H]PiB binding and insoluble Abeta peptide levels. In the Alzheimer's disease subject who underwent PiB-PET prior to death, in vivo PiB retention levels correlated directly with region-matched post-mortem measures of [(3)H]PiB binding, insoluble Abeta peptide levels, 6-CN-PiB- and Abeta plaque load, but not with measures of NFT. These results demonstrate, in a typical Alzheimer's disease brain, that PiB binding is highly selective for insoluble (fibrillar) Abeta deposits, and not for neurofibrillary pathology. The strong direct correlation of in vivo PiB retention with region-matched quantitative analyses of Abeta plaques in the same subject supports the validity of PiB-PET imaging as a method for in vivo evaluation of Abeta plaque burden.},

The differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders based on clinical symptoms alone is particularly difficult during the early stages of the disease. A number of imaging strategies have been developed to differentiate between these clinically similar conditions. The assessment of abnormal patterns of brain metabolism, either by visual inspection or using computer-assisted algorithms, can be used to discriminate between classical PD and atypical variant conditions such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD). Recent advances in network quantification routines have created the basis for fully automated differential diagnosis. Using PET, investigators have identified specific disease-related spatial covariance patterns that are characteristic of PD and its variants. By computing pattern expression in individual patient scans, it has become possible to determine the likelihood of a specific diagnosis. In this review, we describe the various imaging techniques that have been used to diagnose PD with emphasis on the application of network tools. Analogous methods may have value in the assessment of other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions.},

However, diagnosis, even by experts, is challenging; one autopsy series showed an error rate of 24\%. Distinction between various diagnostic possibilities depends on the history and examination findings. The use of certain medications, the rapid rate of disease progression, early onset of falling, the presence of certain dysautonomic symptoms, cognitive or behavioral changes, or a history of poor response to dopaminergic therapy may suggest an atypical form of parkinsonism. Postural hypotension, dementia, supranuclear ophthalmoparesis, or early postural instability should alert the examiner to consider an atypical cause of parkinsonism. Tests of autonomic function and brain imaging are often helpful in distinguishing these diseases.},

Two {SPECT} imaging series were obtained, 12 months apart. The mean annual change in the ratio of specific to non-specific {[123I]}?-CIT binding to the striatum, putamen, and caudate nucleus was used as the outcome measure.Results:A decrease in {[123I]}?-CIT binding ratios between the two images was found in all regions of interest. The average decrease in {[123I]}?-CIT binding ratios was about 8\% in the whole striatum, 8\% in the putaminal region, and 4\% in the caudate region. Comparison of scans done in nine patients under two different conditions?in the off state and while on drug treatment?showed no significant alterations in the expression of striatal dopamine transporters as measured using {[123I]}?-CIT {SPECT}. Power analysis indicated that to detect a significant (p < 0.05) effect of a neuroprotective agent with 0.80 power and 30\% of predicted protection within two years, 216 patients are required in each group when the effects are measured in the whole putamen.Conclusions:{[123I]}?-CIT {SPECT} seems to be a useful tool to investigate the progression of dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson?s disease and may provide an objective method of measuring the effectiveness of neuroprotective treatments. Short term treatment with a D2agonist does not have a significant influence on {[123I]}?-CIT binding to dopamine transporters. If the latter finding is replicated in larger groups of patients, it supports the suitability of {[123I]}?-CIT {SPECT} for examining the progression of neurodegeneration in patients being treated with D2receptor agonists.},

Two independent investigators reviewed and selected the papers according to predefined selection criteria. The quality of the original studies was assessed using one specifically designed scale. {RESULTS} Eleven original articles were included. No randomized clinical trials were found. Three papers assessed the effect of {DaTSCAN} in medication of patients and found that 17 to 69 \% of the patients treatment changed after {SPECT.} Six studies assessed the change in the diagnosis for patients with parkinsonian syndromes after {SPECT.} Four of them showed that {123I-FP} could be useful for the differential diagnosis between {PD} and non-degenerative disorders. One observed that ioflupane could help differentiate between {PD} and {AD} and between this last disease and {LBD.} The other investigation group showed that {DaTSCAN} could help in the differential diagnosis between {PD} and parkinsonian syndromes such as multisystem atrophy {(MSA)} and progressive supranuclear palsy {(PSP).} {CONCLUSIONS} The scientific evidence available indicates that {123I-FP} can be useful to differentiate {PD} from essential tremor and vascular and drug-induced parkinsonism, and also to differentiate {AD} from {LBD.}},

Family studies have shown that autism runs in families and twin studies indicate that the basis of that familial aggregation is genetic. As a result the prospects for the identification of susceptibility genes using either linkage or association studies are quite good. However, recent evidence is accumulating suggesting that the disorder is genetically heterogeneous; higher functioning individuals with autism may arise from separate genetic mechanisms that lower functioning ones. If true, this will make the detection of linkage and association much more difficult.},

  abstract        = {Over the past decade, human neuroimaging studies have provided invaluable insights into the neural substrates that underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although observations from multiple neuroimaging approaches converge in suggesting that changes in brain structure, functioning and connectivity are associated with ASD, the neurobiology of this disorder is complex, and considerable aetiological and phenotypic heterogeneity exists among individuals on the autism spectrum. Characterization of the neurobiological alterations that underlie ASD and development of novel pharmacotherapies for ASD, therefore, requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Consequently, pressure is growing to combine neuroimaging data with information provided by other disciplines to translate research findings into clinically useful biomarkers. So far, however, neuroimaging studies in patients with ASD have mainly been conducted in isolation, and the low specificity of neuroimaging measures has hindered the development of biomarkers that could aid clinical trials and/or facilitate patient identification. Novel approaches to acquiring and analysing data on brain characteristics are currently being developed to overcome these inherent limitations, and to integrate neuroimaging into translational research. Here, we discuss promising new studies of cortical pathology in patients with ASD, and outline how the novel insights thereby obtained could inform diagnosis and treatment of ASD in the future.},

  abstract        = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)-a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7-64 years) (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies.},

However, CV is a product of 2 distinct parameters, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), that in turn have distinct genetic and developmental origins. To investigate regional differences in CV, SA, and CT as well as their relationship in a large and well-characterized sample of men with ASD and matched controls.Multicenter case-control design using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.Medical Research Council UK Autism Imaging Multicentre Study.A total of 168 men, 84 diagnosed as having ASD and 84 controls who did not differ significantly in mean (SD) age (26 [7] years vs 28 [6] years, respectively) or full-scale IQ (110 [14] vs 114 [12], respectively).Between-group differences in CV, SA, and CT investigated using a spatially unbiased vertex-based approach; the degree of spatial overlap between the differences in CT and SA; and their relative contribution to differences in regional CV.Individuals with ASD differed from controls in all 3 parameters. These mainly consisted of significantly increased CT within frontal lobe regions and reduced SA in the orbitofrontal cortex and posterior cingulum. These differences in CT and SA were paralleled by commensurate differences in CV. The spatially distributed patterns for CT and SA were largely nonoverlapping and shared only about 3\% of all significantly different locations on the cerebral surface.Individuals with ASD have significant differences in CV, but these may be underpinned by (separable) variations in its 2 components, CT and SA. This is of importance because both measures result from distinct developmental pathways that are likely modulated by different neurobiological mechanisms. This finding may provide novel targets for future studies into the etiology of the condition and a new way to fractionate the disorder.},

An automated routine utilizing these methods is applied to positron emission tomography (PET) brain data to distinguish several discrete parkinsonian movement disorders with similar clinical manifestations. Disease specific expressions of voxel-based spatial covariance patterns are predetermined using the Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM/PCA) and a scalar measure of the manifestation of each pattern in prospective subject images is subsequently derived. Scores are automatically compared to reference values generated for each pathological condition in a corresponding set of patient and control scans. Diagnostic outcome is optimized using strategies such as the derivation of patterns in a voxel subspace that reflects contrasting image characteristics between conditions, or by using an independent patient population as controls. The prediction models for two, three and four way classification problems using direct scalar comparison as well as classical discriminant analysis are assessed in a composite training population comprised of three different patient classes and normal controls and validated in a similar independent test population. Results illustrate that highly accurate diagnosis can often be achieved by simple comparison of scores utilizing optimized patterns.},

These results were then contrasted with those of FP-CIT SPECT to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure. The specific binding index was evaluated with ROC curves. Results FP-CIT SPECT was highly accurate in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative Parkinsonism (sensitivity: 95\%, specificity: 90\%). Most of the false positive results arose in patients with vascular Parkinsonism and the false negative results in patients with Parkinson disease. ROC curve analysis of semiquantitative evaluation had a sensitivity of 83\% and specificity of 82\% with an optimal cut-off of 1.44. The area under the curve was not significantly different between patients <60 and > 60 years (0.899 vs 0.884) of age.

  abstract  = {Introduction: Reference tissue model (RTM) is a compartmental modeling approach that uses reference tissue time activity curve (TAC) as input for quantification of ligand-receptor dynamic PET without blood sampling. There are limitations in applying the RTM for kinetic analysis of PET studies using [11C]Pittsburgh compound B ([11C]PIB). For region of interest (ROI) based kinetic modeling, the low specific binding of [11C]PIB in a target ROI can result in a high linear relationship between the output and input. This condition may result in amplification of errors in estimates using RTM. For pixel-wise quantification, due to the high noise level of pixel kinetics, the parametric images generated by RTM with conventional linear or nonlinear regression may be too noisy for use in clinical studies.Methods: We applied RTM with parameter coupling and a simultaneous fitting method as a spatial constraint for ROI kinetic analysis. Three RTMs with parameter coupling were derived from a classical compartment model with plasma input: an RTM of 4 parameters (R1, k'2R, k4, BP) (RTM4P); an RTM of 5 parameters (R1, k2R, NS, k6, BP) (RTM5P); and a simplified RTM (SRTM) of 3 parameters (R1, k'2R, BP) (RTM3P). The parameter sets [k'2R, k4], [k2R, NS, k6], and k'2R are coupled among ROIs for RTM4P, RTM5P, and RTM3P, respectively. A linear regression with spatial constraint (LRSC) algorithm was applied to the SRTM for parametric imaging. Logan plots were used to estimate the distribution volume ratio (DVR) (= 1 + BP (binding potential)) in ROI and pixel levels. Ninety-minute [11C]PIB dynamic PET was performed in 28 controls and 6 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on a GE Advance scanner. ROIs of cerebellum (reference tissue) and 15 other regions were defined on coregistered MRIs.Results: The coefficients of variation of DVR estimates from RTM3P obtained by the simultaneous fitting method were lower by 77-89\% (in striatum, frontal, occipital, parietal, and cingulate cortex) as compared to that by conventional single ROI TAC fitting method. There were no significant differences in both TAC fitting and DVR estimates between the RTM3P and the RTM4P or RTM5P. The DVR in striatum, lateral temporal, frontal and cingulate cortex for MCI group was 25\% to 38\% higher compared to the control group (p <= 0.05), even in this group of individuals with generally low PIB retention. The DVR images generated by the SRTM with LRSC algorithm had high linear correlations with those from the Logan plot (R2 = 0.99).Conclusion: In conclusion, the RTM3P with simultaneous fitting method is shown to be a robust compartmental modeling approach that may be useful in [11C]PIB PET studies to detect early markers of Alzheimer's disease where specific ROIs have been hypothesized. In addition, the SRTM with LRSC algorithm may be useful in generating R1 and DVR images for pixel-wise quantification of [11C]PIB dynamic PET.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

  abstract        = {Purpose: In this work, an approach to computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system is proposed as a decision-making aid in Parkinsonian syndrome (PS) detection. This tool, intended for physicians, entails fully automatic preprocessing, normalization, and classification procedures for brain single-photon emission computed tomography images. Methods: Ioflupane[ 123I]FP-CIT images are used to provide in vivo information of the dopamine transporter density. These images are preprocessed using an automated template-based registration followed by two proposed approaches for intensity normalization. A support vector machine (SVM) is used and compared to other statistical classifiers in order to achieve an effective diagnosis using whole brain images in combination with voxel selection masks. Results: The CAD system is evaluated using a database consisting of 208 DaTSCAN images (100 controls, 108 PS). SVM-based classification is the most efficient choice when masked brain images are used. The generalization performance is estimated to be 89.02 (90.41-87.62) sensitivity and 93.21 (92.24-94.18) specificity. The area under the curve can take values of 0.9681 (0.9641-0.9722) when the image intensity is normalized to a maximum value, as derived from the receiver operating characteristics curves. Conclusions: The present analysis allows to evaluate the impact of the design elements for the development of a CAD-system when all the information encoded in the scans is considered. In this way, the proposed CAD-system shows interesting properties for clinical use, such as being fast, automatic, and robust. � 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

I-ioflupane allows to obtain in vivo images of the brain that can be used to assist the PS diagnosis and provides a way to improve its accuracy. In this paper a new method for brain SPECT image feature extraction is shown. This novel Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which decomposes any non-linear and non-stationary time series into a small number of oscillatory Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) a monotonous Residuum. A 80-DaTSCAN image database from the 'Virgen de las Nieves' Hospital in Granada (Spain) was used to evaluate this method, yielding up to 95\% accuracy, which greatly improves the baseline Voxel-As-Feature (VAF) approach.},

Owing to the highly directional architecture of white matter (WM), DTI is providing important clues of the structure and geometric organization of this neural compartment. Since DTI can detect changes even in the case of radiologically "normal" appearing WM, researchers are using the technique for the study of WM integrity at the initial stages of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Along with a well characterized cortical pathology (neuritic plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles), WM changes have been also demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these changes had been for years found nonliable in the onset and progress of AD, basically due to lack of incriminatory evidence. The use of novel tools such as DTI has enabled the anatomical distribution of WM microstructural damage in the prodromal stages of AD to be gauged and determined, granting a long-delayed protagonic role to WM in the natural history of this highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition.},

Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

  abstract    = {Atrophy is regarded a sensitive marker of neurodegenerative pathology. In addition to confirming the well-known presence of decreased global grey matter and hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer's disease, this study investigated whether deep grey matter structure also suffer degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, and whether such degeneration is associated with cognitive deterioration. In this cross-sectional correlation study, two groups were compared on volumes of seven subcortical regions: 70 memory complainers (MCs) and 69 subjects diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease. Using 3T 3D T1 MR images, volumes of nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen and thalamus were automatically calculated by the FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST)--algorithm FMRIB's Software Library (FSL). Subsequently, the volumes of the different regions were correlated with cognitive test results. In addition to finding the expected association between hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, volumes of putamen and thalamus were significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease. We also found that the decrease in volume correlated linearly with impaired global cognitive performance. These findings strongly suggest that, beside neo-cortical atrophy, deep grey matter structures in Alzheimer's disease suffer atrophy as well and that degenerative processes in the putamen and thalamus, like the hippocampus, may contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.},

In this approach, the whole brain image is subdivided in regions or spatial components, and a Bayesian network is used to model the dependencies between affected regions of AD. The structure of relations between affected regions allows to detect neurodegeneration with an estimated performance of 88\% on more than 400 subjects and predict neurodegeneration with 80\% accuracy, supporting the conclusion that modeling the dependencies between components increases the recognition of different patterns of brain degeneration in AD.},

  abstract = {The Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative {(PPMI)} is a comprehensive observational, international, multi-center study designed to identify {PD} progression biomarkers both to improve understanding of disease etiology and course and to provide crucial tools to enhance the likelihood of success of {PD} modifying therapeutic trials. The {PPMI} cohort will comprise 400 recently diagnosed {PD} and 200 healthy subjects followed longitudinally for clinical, imaging and biospecimen biomarker assessment using standardized data acquisition protocols at twenty-one clinical sites. All study data will be integrated in the {PPMI} study database and will be rapidly and publically available through the {PPMI} web site- www.ppmi-info.org. Biological samples including longitudinal collection of blood, cerebrospinal fluid {(CSF)} and urine will be available to scientists by application to an independent {PPMI} biospecimen review committee also through the {PPMI} web site. {PPMI} will rely on a partnership of government, {PD} foundations, industry and academics working cooperatively. This approach is crucial to enhance the potential for success of this ambitious strategy to develop {PD} progression biomarkers that will accelerate research in disease modifying therapeutics.},

  abstract = {A new criterion for multilevel thresholding is proposed. The criterion is based on the consideration of two factors. The first one is the discrepancy between the thresholded and original images and the second one is the number of bits required to represent the thresholded image. Based on a new maximum correlation criterion for bilevel thresholding, the discrepancy is defined and then a cost function that takes both factors into account is proposed for multilevel thresholding. By minimizing the cost function, the classification number that the gray-levels should be classified and the threshold values can be determined automatically. In addition, the cost function is proven to possess a unique minimum under very mild conditions. Computational analyses indicate that the number of required mathematical operations in the implementation of our algorithm is much less than that of maximum entropy criterion. Finally, simulation results are included to demonstrate their effectiveness},
